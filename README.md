# AutoDocs

## I would like AutoDocs to:
- Traverse a directory that is filled with other repos and look into every files
- It will grab all meaning full text from kubernettes test files
- It will organize these meaning full test data with proper repo titles and such to
display a comprehensive documentation

- (hard) It will be able to tell what words are key words like variables, then go to find such variables and capture what that data looks like

- (hard) It will be able to send valuable text data to an Ai to summarize is greater detail the documents

- It will be able to search for the source of true for what data is being used in an env and display/generate fake data based off these schemas
- (hard) It will be able to show how the data is linked together.
