# AutoDocs

## I would like AutoDocs to:
- (done) Traverse a directory that is filled with other repos and look into every files
- (done) It will grab all meaning full text from cucumber test files
- (done) It will organize these meaning full test data with proper repo titles and such to
display a comprehensive documentation

- (doing) It will be able to search for the source of truth for what data is being used in an env and display/generate fake data based off these schemas

- (hard) It will be able to tell what words are key words like variables, then go to find such variables and capture what that data looks like

- (hard) It will be able to send valuable text data to an Ai to summarize is greater detail the documents

- (hard) It will be able to show how the data is linked together.
